# Interval 0.23.0 — Phase 1 Freeze

*Release 0.24.0 · protocol spec v0.69 · consensus spec v1.9 · rules hash `875de79db259fcf5…`. These four move together; a change to any is a new release.*

A decentralized MMO protocol. The game is a deterministic state machine,
the spec is the constitution, and the rules are the authority: not a
server. The world advances in fixed intervals; everything that ever
happens, happens on one.

Live world: [interval.place](https://interval.place). Source and
constitution: [github.com/intervalplace/interval](https://github.com/intervalplace/interval).

Design homage: Interval is deeply inspired by early-2000s RuneScape,
its tick-based time, discrete systems, and coherent fixed rules. Interval
is an independent project with no affiliation to Jagex.

## Tested against a hostile network

Consensus safety is exercised by a seeded, deterministic adversarial
simulator (`npm run advsim`): honest witnesses under packet loss, delay,
reordering, duplication, and timed partitions, alongside Byzantine
witnesses (equivocating proposers, lying attesters, replayers, garbage
floods) and crash-restart recovery from durable stores. Three test
surfaces cover it, all enumerated in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md): the CI
battery (`test/adversarial.test.mjs`, 15 tests — every scenario at one
seed plus convergence and determinism checks), the **attached freeze
evidence** (`freeze-evidence/`, all 12 scenarios × 1 seed × 11s), and
the full campaign on demand (`node advsim.mjs all 3 30000`, 12 scenarios
× 3 seeds × 30s). Across the runs in the attached evidence, no two
honest nodes finalized different hashes for the same tick, no honest
witness double-signed, and every committed certificate verified — the
world stops rather than forks. These are claims about the enumerated
runs, not a proof over all executions. The same properties are shown
live over real libp2p (`npm run demo7`) and across real OS processes
(`npm run
e2e`); those two bind real sockets and are captured separately (see
TESTING.md and `INTERVAL_LIVE=1 npm run evidence`), not in the default
evidence run.

## The network is real

Two sovereign machines now run this world. A pillar founds it and
serves the web window; any stranger runs `node join.mjs <name>`
and becomes a full peer: their machine fetches the founding record,
refuses unless its own SPEC.md hashes to the same constitution, syncs a
checkpoint, and then computes every tick independently, comparing state
hashes with everyone else. Keys are generated locally and never leave.
The first foreign citizen was named zezima, because of course it was.

By default a joined citizen simply exists while its node verifies the
world. Add `--chop` for the example executor: a bot that trains
woodcutting and banks its logs. Bots and people enter the world the
same way; the protocol cannot tell them apart, and does not want to.

## New in v0.23: the world learns to stop, safely

Phase 1 is frozen. The consensus core — canonical interval bundles, a
Byzantine-safe intersecting quorum (`n≥3f+1`, `q≥2f+1`, `2q−n>f`),
durable vote locks, certified finality, and halt-not-fork recovery — is
now settled and will not change; storage engines, monitoring, and tooling
may still evolve beneath it. Witnesses hold a true kernel-backed
host-local lock, default to a SQLite finality store with strict world
binding, drain every checkpoint write before releasing exclusivity (and
fail closed if the last one cannot be written), and verify only the
recent tail of history at startup so a witness boots in constant time no
matter how long the world has run. A release manifest derives every test
count and version banner from the source tree, so the documentation
cannot quietly drift from what actually ships.

## New in v0.19: nobody builds a fire to stand in it

After successfully lighting a fire the maker steps aside to the first
free orthogonal tile (west, east, south, north). A one-line amendment,
and the ninth constitution this world has lived under.

## New in v0.18: the world gains memory and warmth

- **The bank (§6g)**: `player.bank` is a vault, a map of item to
  quantity. Deposit and withdraw beside a bank node, one item per
  interval: patience is the fee. **The bank survives death.** What you
  carry can burn; what you vault endures. Wealth can finally accumulate.
- **Firemaking (§6f)**: light logs where you stand. Beacon-rolled
  success consumes the logs and births a `fire` node that cooks like a
  campfire, pushes back the night, and burns out after a minute. The
  logs sink doubles as social infrastructure: light, made by hand.
- Citizens now persist across restarts (checkpoint + founding record on
  disk) and **migrate across constitutions**: when the rules change, a
  new world is founded whose genesis imports every citizen's skills,
  name, hp, vault, and surviving items. Progress is sacred; worlds are
  replaceable.

## New in v0.16: the economy grows a spine

- **Smithing (§6d)**: at an anvil, ore and logs become a bronze sword
  (+2 max hit), hatchet, or pickaxe (+24 gather threshold on the
  matching node). 30 xp per ore.
- **Equipment (§5d)**: `wield` and `unwield`; wielded gear is visible
  on the citizen and destroyed on death. The sink spares nothing.
- **Loot lies where it falls (§6e)**: mob drops become ground items on
  the mob's tile. The killer has no special claim.
- **Chat (§9c)**: an auxiliary gossip topic, signed by the speaking
  key, 80 characters, one message per interval. Never part of world
  state: the world does not remember what was said, only who said it.

## New in v0.15: the ground remembers (briefly)

- All interaction is **orthogonal** now: you stand before what you
  work, facing it. Diagonal movement stays legal.
- **Ground items (§3.4)**: `drop` places an item on your tile, visible
  to all, takeable by anyone, gone in 100 ticks. Litter, loot, and
  gifts are one mechanic.

## New in v0.11 through v0.14: the world becomes a place

- v0.11: the world is a bounded grid; it has edges because we say it
  does.
- v0.12: eating clears your current action. Eating mid-fight trades a
  swing for the heal.
- v0.13: nodes are impassable. You fish beside the water, not in it.
- v0.14: world dimensions live in genesis; how much world there is, is
  a founding decision. Spawn is the center tile.

## The windows grew up too

None of this is consensus, all of it is client, any of it may be
reskinned: a login gate that shows the living world behind the door
and wakes the audio on entry; a day/night cycle derived purely from
the shared tick (2400 ticks to a day) with campfires holding back the
darkness; depth-sorted rendering, shadows, ponds with jumping fish,
ember drift; citizens whose tunic, skin, and hair derive from their
public key, so your identity is written on your clothes; and a full
procedural soundscape, every thock, splash, fanfare, bird, and cricket
synthesized from oscillators at the moment it happens. No asset files.
A world made of rules makes its sounds out of math.

## New in v0.10: the world tolerates imperfect nodes

- **Catch-up by replay** (spec §9b). Nodes retain a recent input log and
  serve contiguous ranges of it. A node that stalls: laptop lid, network
  blip: wakes behind, fetches the ticks it missed, and REPLAYS them
  through the state machine. No trust extended: replay recomputes every
  state and hash gossip judges the result. In `demo5.mjs`, node C
  freezes for 6 ticks while the world carries on, then catches up and
  finishes in perfect agreement, having "witnessed" history it slept
  through. Falls back to checkpoint re-sync when the gap exceeds peers'
  logs. Determinism makes history replayable; replayability makes
  stalls survivable.

## New in v0.9: combat, a universal engine, and the first graphical window

- **Combat** (spec §6b/§6c). Attack, defence, hitpoints. Goblins with
  beacon-rolled hits, damage, retaliation, drops, and 16-tick respawns.
  Death is provisional and brutal: respawn with your inventory
  destroyed: the deepest sink. Softer death rules are an expected fork;
  §6c says so in writing. Eat cooked fish to heal: the full loop,
  fish → cook → eat → fight: is closed.
- **Universal engine.** node:crypto is gone; the engine runs on
  @noble/ed25519 + @noble/hashes: pure, audited, deterministic JS that
  runs identically in Node and browsers. The last platform-determinism
  risk is closed.
- **The reference graphical window.** `node serve.mjs yourname`, open
  http://localhost:8787: an early-RuneScape-style low-poly canvas
  client: chunky tiles, polygon trees, stone-bevel panel, gold-on-brown
  text, the 4×7 inventory grid. Click to walk, gather, fight, cook, eat.
  It is deliberately ONE aesthetic among many: the protocol has no
  authoritative graphics, and every client is a reskin of the same truth.

## New in v0.8: the first sink

- **Fishing** (gathering): `fishing-spot` nodes yield `raw-fish`
  (30 XP), same depletion economics as trees and rocks.
- **Cooking** (processing): stand by a `campfire`, `cook {slot}`: the
  beacon rolls; success gives `cooked-fish` + 30 XP, failure gives
  `burnt-fish` and nothing. **Either way the raw fish is destroyed.**
  This is the economy's first sink: gathering creates supply, processing
  burns it. Burn rate falls with level, exactly like the classic curve,
  a fresh cook chars most of the catch.
- `play.mjs`: `f` to cook. The window shows ≈ fishing spots and ♨ fire.

## New in v0.7: one clock, one self

- **The shared clock** (spec §2). Genesis now carries `anchorMs`: tick N
  finalizes at `anchorMs + (N+1)*600`, computed independently by every
  node. In `demo4.mjs` there is no tick driver at all: two nodes
  self-advance on pure arithmetic and stay in perfect lockstep while
  players act through the SDK. The world has one clock and it is math.
- **Identity persistence.** `loadOrCreateIdentity` saves your keypair to
  disk: same key, same playerId, same character, forever. `play.mjs` now
  remembers who you are between sessions. Guard the file: it IS your
  character; there is no password reset in a world with no authority.

## New in v0.6: citizens and commerce

- **Spawning** (spec §5b). A player no longer needs to exist in genesis:
  `spawn` is a constitutional input, the only one valid for an unknown
  playerId. In `demo3.mjs`, charlie's node late-joins a running world,
  he spawns, names himself, and grinds: the complete stranger-to-citizen
  journey, witnessed identically by every node.
- **Trade** (spec §5c). Two-phase atomic swap: offer, then accept. It
  settles whole in one tick or not at all: no escrow, no partial state.
  And it requires **adjacency**: trade demands being there. The first
  economy primitive is also the first presence-rewarding mechanic.
- **You can play it.** `node play.mjs yourname`: WASD to walk, g to
  gather, one input per 600ms interval exactly as the constitution
  demands. Your keypress and a bot's API call remain indistinguishable.

## The first fork

v0.4 changed the constitution (names, checkpoints), so its rules hash
differs from v0.3's: meaning **v0.4 is a new world**, on separate
gossip topics, invisible to v0.3 peers. This is governance by exit
operating on the project itself: nobody was forced to upgrade; a v0.3
world could still be run by anyone who prefers it.

## The website

`node serve.mjs yourname` now serves the whole front door on
http://localhost:8787: landing page with a live tick counter, the
New Player Guide, The Manual, live Hiscores, and the playable browser
window at `/play`. All in the reference window's stone-and-gold
aesthetic. The node also speaks JSON: `/api/world`, `/api/hiscores`,
`/api/player/:name`: every hiscores site is just another window.

## Files

- `SPEC.md`: the protocol constitution (intervals, XP, gathering,
  verifiable RNG, worlds & forks)
- `CONSENSUS.md`: the agreement protocol, formally — witness locking,
  quorum intersection, verification invariants, failure model, halting
  conditions (normative for `protocol.mjs` / `agreement.mjs`)
- `protocol.mjs`: wire objects — bundles, attestations, finality
  records, evidence; the one proof verifier
- `agreement.mjs`: proposer rounds, durable vote locks, quorum
  finality, halt-not-fork
- `engine.js`: reference state machine, zero dependencies, pure functions
- `sim.js`: single-process determinism proof + adversarial tests
- `node.mjs`: the networked node: engine + gossipsub + persistence +
  checkpoint serving + corroborated late-join
- `demo.mjs`: 4 real nodes on localhost, one cheating
- `demo2.mjs`: names claimed live, disk checkpoints, and a node joining
  mid-world by corroborating checkpoints from 2 peers
- `worldgen.mjs`: terrain as a pure function of genesis; every node
  grows the identical landscape from the founding record
- `join.mjs`: the foreign node. Join any world from its URL with your
  own node and locally held keys; `--chop` runs the example executor
- `serve.mjs`: the pillar: node + web window + site + JSON API + chat
  bridge + per-visitor custodial identities + citizen migration
- `deploy/interval.place.nginx.conf`: reverse proxy config (WebSocket
  headers are load-bearing; the p2p port is dialed directly)
- `sdk.mjs`: layer 2: the client library (read the world, sign actions)
- `window-term.mjs`: layer 3: the first window (terminal renderer,
  built purely on the SDK: imports nothing from node or engine)
- `session.mjs`: a played session: alice claims her name, walks to a
  tree and chops it; bob runs a bot through the same SDK
- `demo3.mjs`: the first trade (atomic, adjacent) and charlie's
  stranger-to-citizen journey (late-join → spawn → name → gather)
- `play.mjs`: interactive solo client: WASD, g gather, x attack,
  f cook, e eat; persistent identity
- `serve.mjs` + `window-web.html`: WebSocket bridge, the reference
  graphical window, the website, and the JSON API
- `site/`: landing page, New Player Guide, The Manual, Hiscores
- `demo4.mjs`: self-driving nodes on the arithmetic clock + identity
  reloaded from disk

## Run

```
npm install     # libp2p stack (only needed for the network demo)
node sim.js     # zero-dependency engine proof
node demo.mjs   # a live 4-node world with a cheater
node demo2.mjs  # names + persistence + late join
node session.mjs # a played world, rendered in the terminal window
node demo3.mjs   # spawning + the first trade
node play.mjs bob # play it yourself (real terminal required)
node demo4.mjs   # no tick driver: the clock is arithmetic
node serve.mjs bob # then open http://localhost:8787: the graphical window
node demo5.mjs   # a node stalls, wakes behind, catches up by replay
```

Note: gossipsub v14 requires the libp2p v2.x generation: the
`package.json` pins compatible versions (interface mismatch with
libp2p v3 causes silent stream failures).

## What this proves

1. **Determinism**: independent implementations of the spec converge
   byte-for-byte, tick after tick.
2. **Verifiability**: every drop roll derives from a public beacon;
   any peer can audit any other peer's claimed progress.
3. **Rule-as-authority**: a cheater's state hash simply doesn't match,
   and honest peers ignore it. No server, no anti-cheat team.

## Governance by exit

The rules cannot be amended, only succeeded. An "update" is a new world
(new rules hash) that shares history up to the fork tick. If players
prefer the old rules, they keep running them: both timelines live, and
population decides which ones matter. Nobody has to accept an update,
ever.

## New in v0.5: the three layers are real

- **Layer 1 (node):** constitution + consensus. Headless. Unchanged.
- **Layer 2 (SDK):** `IntervalClient`: read the world, act in it
  (`move`, `gather`, `claimName`), subscribe to ticks. Knows nothing
  about pixels. Humans and bots use this identical interface: in
  `session.mjs`, alice's scripted "hands" and bob's bot are
  indistinguishable to the protocol: bot indifference made concrete.
- **Layer 3 (window):** a terminal renderer built purely on the SDK.
  The first of many windows. Anyone can build another (web, pixel-art,
  spreadsheet) without touching consensus code.

## New in v0.4

- **Names are in-world objects** (spec §5a). `claim_name` is a
  constitutional action: first valid claim wins, one name per player,
  simultaneous claims resolve deterministically. No external name
  service needed: identity lives in world state like everything else.
- **Persistence.** Nodes checkpoint the full world to disk every tick
  and resume from it on restart. The world survives.
- **Late join** (spec §9a). A new peer fetches checkpoints from ≥2
  independent peers, verifies the hashes agree, adopts, and marches in
  lockstep from there: inheriting history it never witnessed. One peer
  is never enough: corroboration, not authority.

## New in v0.3

- **It's a real network now.** Nodes are libp2p peers. Signed inputs are
  gossiped on a world-specific topic; every node advances the world in
  lockstep on the 600ms schedule and publishes its state hash each tick.
- **Topics are namespaced by rules hash.** A different constitution is a
  different gossip network. Forks are separate worlds *by construction*,
  peers on different rules never even hear each other.
- **Divergence detection.** Honest nodes compare hashes every tick. The
  demo runs three honest nodes and one cheater (double-XP modified
  engine): the cheater's hash diverges on tick 1 and all honest nodes
  flag and ignore it. Symmetrically, the cheater flags the honest nodes,
  from its perspective, *they* left. That asymmetry resolves socially:
  a world is whoever agrees with each other.

## New in v0.2

- **Real identities.** Players are ed25519 keypairs; every input is
  signed, and the state machine itself verifies signatures. Forged,
  tampered, and replayed inputs are all rejected (see `sim.js` tests).
- **Hardcoded XP table.** Spec constants now: no floats anywhere in
  consensus logic. The v0.1 caveat is closed.
- **Genesis object with rules hash.** A world's genesis contains the
  spec version and the SHA-256 of the constitution. Two peers are in
  the same world iff their genesis matches: forks are now detectable
  in code, not just in principle.

## Known v0.2 caveats

- Beacon is a hash chain from the genesis seed (predictable). Production
  needs a distributed beacon (e.g. drand) so future rolls are unknowable.

## Roadmap

- **third independent node**: completes real checkpoint corroboration
  (two or more peers; the founder's word stops being enough)
- **v1.0**: true browser light clients: browser-side keys and signing
  (the engine already runs there; HTTPS unlocks WebCrypto), so the
  pillar stops holding anyone's key
- **distributed beacon**: today's beacon is deterministic and therefore
  precomputable; fine among friends, exploitable at scale
- **beyond**: sharding (regions as gossip subtopics), presence events
  ("presence cannot be automated"), a second mob tier, more skills
