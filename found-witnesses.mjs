// found-witnesses.mjs: prepare the witness set for a world, BEFORE founding it.
//
//   node found-witnesses.mjs 3
//
// Writes one identity file per witness into ./witness-keys/ and prints the
// exact environment each machine needs. Run this ONCE, on a machine you trust,
// then distribute one private key to each node and keep every key backed up
// somewhere that is not those machines.
//
// WHY THIS IS A ONE-WAY DOOR
//
// The witness set is written into genesis and hashed into the worldId. It can
// never be added to, rotated, or repaired. A world founded with one witness
// whose key is later lost is a world that has stopped forever, with no appeal
// and no fix, and every citizen's work inside it frozen at the last tick that
// was signed. This is not a recoverable mistake, so it is worth ten minutes
// now.
//
// HOW MANY
//
//   1  the world stops when that one machine stops. Fine for a test, and only
//      for a test.
//   2  WORSE THAN ONE. The quorum becomes 2, so both must be online: you have
//      doubled the ways to halt and gained nothing.
//   3  the first honest choice. Quorum 2, so any single machine can die, be
//      rebooted, run out of disk or fall off the network and the world keeps
//      its clock. Tolerates no LIAR, which is fine when all three are yours.
//   4  the first that survives a witness that lies rather than merely stops.
//      This is the number if anyone else is to hold a key, because then the
//      threat is no longer only crashes.
